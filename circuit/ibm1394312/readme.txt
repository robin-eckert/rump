This directory contains circuit and board layout for the 122-key IBM
1394312 terminal keyboard. The circuit is based on clee's circuit in
the above directory and adapted to the 20 pin matrix connector of the
122 key variant. The additional jumper JUMPER2 is done for future
extension and not used yet.

As I don't do much electronics, the circuit and board could very
probably be done better. I etched the board one-side only and replaced
the only two traces on the top by wire straps.

The board layout was done with FreePCB (www.freepcb.com)
